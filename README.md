## Governance Artifacts

- `Vocab.txt` – Ordered token list.  
- `SemanticMap.json` – Token clusters & hierarchy.  
- `Constraints.json` – Near/Far rules, quarantines, invariants.  
- `Manifest.json` – Hashes, signers, intended use.  
- `Manifest.sig` – Digital signature.

## Expected Benefits

- **Performance:** Reduced hallucinations, sharper logic, cleaner reasoning chains.  
- **Security:** Attested mental structure prevents backdoors.  
- **Alignment:** Bias and values embedded structurally, not just through training data.  
- **Governance:** Full transparency into AI’s conceptual wiring.

## Risks & Mitigations

- **Risk:** Malicious actor signs a corrupt map.  
  **Mitigation:** Require multi-party review & signing.  

- **Risk:** Fine-tuning alters token distances.  
  **Mitigation:** Drift monitoring & probe testing.  

- **Risk:** Over-constraining limits creative problem-solving.  
  **Mitigation:** Use adjustable “obsession dials” per cluster.

## Next Steps

1. **Prototype:** Build remapping tool & manifest signing system.  
2. **Demonstrate:** Compare current vs. STM models on reasoning accuracy & bias isolation.  
3. **Deploy Pilot:** Military/enterprise alignment testbed.  
4. **Integrate:** Add attestation checks to AI deployment pipelines.

## Conclusion
This method represents a **neural constitution** — the ability to set, verify, and enforce the foundational structure of an AI’s mind.  

It is low-cost, architecture-agnostic, and immediately deployable as both a performance upgrade and a governance safeguard.
